<h2>What are you doing here?</h2>

I remember a friend sending me this quote:
>"People think that computer science is the art of geniuses but the actual reality is the opposite, just many people doing things that build on each other, like a wall of mini stones."
-Donald Knuth.

For many years, I was quite simply overwhelmed with the daunting task of learning to code and the reason for it.	
So I like to think that quote summises quite perfectly, _Why I'm Here_.	

After coming to the realisation that the world quite _literally_ runs on free(most of the time) and open-source code, I knew that I could and <b>should</b> contribute wherever my skillset allows me to. 
<h4><i>Disclaimer</i>, I'm largely still learning.</h4> 
<h4>However, I love learning, I love contributing and I love the thought of moving forward with each contribution to the larger world of software.</h4>

<h2><i>Alright</i>. What's Your Skillset? </h2>
I'll keep this list updated as I become more proficient in things.
